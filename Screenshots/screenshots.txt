Problem 1 Solution:
I was realizing my grid was printing the same index for an entire row, so I double-checked both functions and I realized
my print function was printing array[i] instead of array[i*n+j].

Problem 2 Solution:
I corrected my calculations for determining the neighboring cells, however I also discovered I did not
set my tree cell to anything if there was no fire neighbor creating a new problem and no break to move on to
the next conditional statements.

Problem 3 Solution:
technically a part of problem 2, but I did not add a tree initialization at the beginning of the loop
I originally added it after which was problematic because if it was determined to be neighboring
a fire cell, I just reset it back to a tree cell. So I placed my tree initialization before the loop.

Problem 4 Solution:
I had to dereference the array in order to use the binary operator ==.
